Extra Credit assessment 2

From my research i found that most tech company used more than just one tech stack for their entire product,
it seems however that a specific stack might be used from a give aspect of a program for example i found that
Pinterest uses javaScript, C++, varnish, Zookeeper and Envoy. for Web Deployments but for add Analytics they use mySQL, kafka, Apache Spark
Hadoop, Druid and Hbase.
